NES+G or New England Solar and Green Inc. evolved from Guntlow & Associates, Inc. where for almost 30 years we have been providing engineering and design services in the Solar Energy Setup.
G&A was established in 1989 by Vincent Guntlow, a professional civil engineer who is registered in five states. The firm is a multidisciplinary design consulting firm in Williamstown, Massachusetts and offers services that include civil and environmental engineering along with property and topographic survey, landscape architecture, wetland consulting and architecture. A mid-sized firm, that takes great pride in its direct, hands-on involvement in all projects. All work is directly reviewed, by the owner/principal, with the utmost attention paid to quality and the best interests of its clients. A great reputation with clients, contractors and permitting agencies is what makes G&A so successful.
